Conclusions: 
* The best Performing prediction Model based on Date and Closing Price was LSTM.  It had much lower RMSE scores.
* Next steps: would create a dashboard with drop down menu of charts and LSTM prediction model 

* As accurate as machine intelligence stock predictors may be, they will not alleviate the very human 
emotions of wanting to buy and sell inherent in owning stocks:
- Timeframe - buying and holding vs day or swing trading 
- too much of overall portfolio allocated to one stock or sector
- fluctuations in price and volatility
- Large percent moves up or down in short time frames
- With bigger moves up comes bigger moves down
- Random nature of stock market
- “Staying in” if/when model is dramatically incorrect 
	- Dramatic decline in index price values in February due to pandemic 
	- BYND price decline approx 11/10 when rumor MCD may become competitor not partner
